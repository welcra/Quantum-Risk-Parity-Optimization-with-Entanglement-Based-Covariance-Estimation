# Quantum Risk Parity Optimization with Entanglement-Based Covariance Estimation
Quantum portfolio optimization, where the covariance matrix of asset returns is estimated using a quantum kernel. By embedding historical asset return time series into a quantum feature space with full entanglement, the resulting covariance matrix captures complex quantum correlations beyond classical statistics. The portfolio weights are then optimized to achieve risk parity, ensuring balanced risk contributions from all assets.

Future Prospects:

- Add a classical benchmark (to see how much bette/worse the quantum optimizer is)
- Replace classical covariance with quantum-informed distance
